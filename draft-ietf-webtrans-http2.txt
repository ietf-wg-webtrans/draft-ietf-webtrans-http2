Abstract

   WebTransport defines a set of low-level communications features
   designed for client-server interactions that are initiated by Web
   clients.  This document describes a protocol that can provide many of
   the capabilities of WebTransport over HTTP/2.  This protocol enables
   the use of WebTransport when a UDP-based protocol is not available.

1.  Introduction

   WebTransport [OVERVIEW] is designed to provide generic communication
   capabilities to Web clients that use HTTP/3 [HTTP3].  The HTTP/3
   WebTransport protocol [WEBTRANSPORT-H3] allows Web clients to use
   QUIC [QUIC] features such as streams or datagrams [DATAGRAM].
   However, there are some environments where QUIC cannot be deployed.

   This document defines a protocol that provides all of the core
   functions of WebTransport using HTTP semantics.  This includes
   unidirectional streams, bidirectional streams, and datagrams.

   By relying only on generic HTTP semantics, this protocol might allow
   deployment using any HTTP version.  However, this document only
   defines negotiation for HTTP/2 [HTTP2] as the current most common
   TCP-based fallback to HTTP/3.

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document follows terminology defined in Section 1.2 of
   [OVERVIEW].  Note that this document distinguishes between a
   WebTransport server and an HTTP/2 server.  An HTTP/2 server is the
   server that terminates HTTP/2 connections; a WebTransport server is
   an application that accepts WebTransport sessions, which can be
   accessed using HTTP/2 and this protocol.

2.  Protocol Overview

   WebTransport servers are identified by an HTTPS URI as defined in
   Section 4.2.2 of [HTTP].

   When an HTTP/2 connection is established, the server sends a
   SETTINGS_WT_MAX_SESSIONS setting with a value greater than "0" to
   indicate that it supports WebTransport over HTTP/2.  The value of the
   setting is the number of concurrent sessions the server is willing to
   receive.  Note that the client does not need to send any value to
   indicate support for WebTransport; clients indicate support for
   WebTransport by using the "webtransport" upgrade token in CONNECT
   requests establishing WebTransport sessions (Section 9.1 of
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H3]).

   A client initiates a WebTransport session by sending an extended
   CONNECT request [RFC8441].  If the server accepts the request, a
   WebTransport session is established.  The stream that carries the
   CONNECT request is used to exchange bidirectional data for the
   session.  This stream will be referred to as a _CONNECT stream_.  The
   stream ID of a CONNECT stream, which will be referred to as a
   _Session ID_, is used to uniquely identify a given WebTransport
   session within the connection.  WebTransport using HTTP/2 uses
   extended CONNECT with the same webtransport HTTP Upgrade Token as
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H3].  This Upgrade Token uses the Capsule Protocol as
   defined in [HTTP-DATAGRAM].

   After the session is established, endpoints exchange WebTransport
   messages using the Capsule Protocol on the bidirectional CONNECT
   stream, the "data stream" as defined in Section 3.1 of
   [HTTP-DATAGRAM].

   Within this stream, _WebTransport streams_ and _WebTransport
   datagrams_ are multiplexed.  In HTTP/2, WebTransport capsules are
   carried in HTTP/2 DATA frames.  Multiple independent WebTransport
   sessions can share a connection if the HTTP version supports that, as
   HTTP/2 does.

   WebTransport capsules closely mirror a subset of QUIC frames and
   provide the essential WebTransport features.  Within a WebTransport
   session, endpoints can create and use bidirectional or unidirectional
   streams with no additional round trips using the WT_STREAM capsule.

   Stream creation and data flow on streams uses flow control mechanisms
   modeled on those in QUIC.  Flow control is managed using the
   WebTransport capsules: WT_MAX_DATA, WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA,
   WT_MAX_STREAMS, WT_DATA_BLOCKED, WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED, and
   WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED.  Flow control for the CONNECT stream as a whole,
   as provided by the HTTP version in use, applies in addition to any
   WebTransport-session-level flow control.

   WebTransport streams can be aborted using a WT_RESET_STREAM capsule
   and a receiver can request that a sender stop sending with a
   WT_STOP_SENDING capsule.

   A WebTransport session is terminated when the CONNECT stream that
   created it is closed.  This implicitly closes all WebTransport
   streams that were multiplexed over that CONNECT stream.

3.  Session Establishment and Termination

   A WebTransport session is a communication context between a client
   and server [OVERVIEW].  This section describes how sessions begin and
   end.

3.1.  Establishing a WebTransport-Capable HTTP/2 Connection

   In order to indicate support for WebTransport, the server MUST send a
   SETTINGS_WT_MAX_SESSIONS value greater than "0" in its SETTINGS
   frame.  The client MUST NOT send a WebTransport request until it has
   received the setting indicating WebTransport support from the server.

3.2.  Extended CONNECT in HTTP/2

   [RFC8441] defines an extended CONNECT method in Section 5, enabled by
   the SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL parameter.  A server supporting
   WebTransport needs to send both the SETTINGS_WT_MAX_SESSIONS setting
   with a value greater than "0" and the
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL setting with a value of "1" for
   WebTransport to be enabled.

3.3.  Creating a New Session

   As WebTransport sessions are established over HTTP, they are
   identified using the https URI scheme [RFC7230].

   In order to create a new WebTransport session, a client can send an
   HTTP CONNECT request.  The :protocol pseudo-header field ([RFC8441])
   MUST be set to webtransport (Section 7.1 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H3]).  The
   :scheme field MUST be https.  Both the :authority and the :path value
   MUST be set; those fields indicate the desired WebTransport server.
   In a Web context, the request MUST include an Origin header field
   [ORIGIN] that includes the origin of the site that requested the
   creation of the session.

   Upon receiving an extended CONNECT request with a :protocol field set
   to webtransport, the HTTP server checks if the identified resource
   supports WebTransport sessions.  If the resource does not, the server
   SHOULD reply with status code 406 (Section 15.5.7 of [RFC9110]).  If
   it does, it MAY accept the session by replying with a 2xx series
   status code, as defined in Section 15.3 of [SEMANTICS].  The
   WebTransport server MUST verify the Origin header to ensure that the
   specified origin is allowed to access the server in question.

   A WebTransport session is established when the server sends a 2xx
   response.  A server generates that response from the request header,
   not from the contents of the request.  To enable clients to resend
   data when attempting to re-establish a session that was rejected by a
   server, a server MUST NOT process any capsules on the request stream
   unless it accepts the WebTransport session.

   A client MAY optimistically send any WebTransport capsules associated
   with a CONNECT request, without waiting for a response, to the extent
   allowed by flow control.  This can reduce latency for data sent by a
   client at the start of a WebTransport session.  For example, a client
   might choose to send datagrams or flow control updates before
   receiving any response from the server.

3.4.  Application Protocol Negotiation

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 offers a subprotocol negotiation mechanism,
   similar to TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension
   (ALPN) [RFC7301]; the intent is to simplify porting pre-existing
   protocols that rely on this type of functionality.

   The user agent MAY include a WT-Available-Protocols header field in
   the CONNECT request.  The WT-Available-Protocols enumerates the
   possible protocols in preference order.  If the server receives such
   a header, it MAY include a WT-Protocol field in a successful (2xx)
   response.  If it does, the server MUST include a single choice from
   the client's list in that field.  Servers MAY reject the request if
   the client did not include a suitable protocol.

   Both WT-Available-Protocols and WT-Protocol are defined in
   Section 3.4 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H3].

3.5.  Session Termination and Error Handling

   An WebTransport session over HTTP/2 is terminated when either
   endpoint closes the stream associated with the CONNECT request that
   initiated the session.

   Prior to closing the stream associated with the CONNECT request,
   either endpoint can send a WT_CLOSE_SESSION capsule with an
   application error code and message to convey additional information
   about the reasons for the closure of the session.

   Session errors result in the termination of a session.  Errors can be
   reported using the WT_CLOSE_SESSION capsule, which includes an error
   code and an optional explanatory message.

   An endpoint can terminate a session without sending a
   WT_CLOSE_SESSION capsule by closing the HTTP/2 stream.

   A stream that is reset terminates the session without providing an
   application-level signal, though there will be an HTTP/2 error code.

   This document reserves the following HTTP/2 error codes for use with
   reporting WebTransport errors:

   WEBTRANSPORT_ERROR (0xTBD):  This generic error can be used for
      errors that do not have more specific error codes.

   WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM_STATE_ERROR (0xTBD):  A stream-related capsule
      identified a stream that was in an invalid state.

   Prior terminating a stream with an error, a WT_CLOSE_SESSION capsule
   with an application-specified error code MAY be sent.

   Session errors do not necessarily result in any change of HTTP/2
   connection state, except that an endpoint might choose to terminate a
   connection in response to stream errors; see Section 5.4 of [HTTP2].

4.  Flow Control

   Flow control governs the amount of resources that can be consumed or
   data that can be sent.  WebTransport over HTTP/2 allows a server to
   limit the number of sessions that a client can create on a single
   connection; see Section 4.1.

   For data, there are five applicable levels of flow control for data
   that is sent or received using WebTransport over HTTP/2:

   1.  TCP flow control.

   2.  HTTP/2 connection flow control, which governs the total amount of
       data in DATA frames for all HTTP/2 streams.

   3.  HTTP/2 stream flow control, which limits the data on a single
       HTTP/2 stream.  For a WebTransport session, this includes all
       capsules, including those that are exempt from WebTransport
       session-level flow control.

   4.  WebTransport session-level flow control, which limits the total
       amount of stream data that can be sent or received on streams
       within the WebTransport session.  Note that this does not limit
       other types of capsules within a WebTransport session, such as
       control messages or datagrams.

   5.  WebTransport stream flow control, which limits data on individual
       streams within a session.

   TCP and HTTP/2 define the first three levels of flow control.  This
   document defines the final two.

4.1.  Limiting the Number of Simultaneous Sessions

   This document defines a SETTINGS_WT_MAX_SESSIONS parameter that
   allows the server to limit the maximum number of concurrent
   WebTransport sessions on a single HTTP/2 connection.  The client MUST
   NOT open more concurrent sessions than indicated by the server
   SETTINGS parameters.

   SETTINGS synchronization via acknowledgements in HTTP/2 enables both
   endpoints to agree on the current value of each setting
   (Section 6.5.3 of [HTTP2]).  A WebTransport server enforces the
   session limit at the time a new session is opened by comparing the
   number of currently open WebTransport sessions against the currently
   acknowledged SETTINGS value for SETTINGS_WT_MAX_SESSIONS.  A server
   that receives an incoming CONNECT stream that would cause it to
   exceed its session limit MUST reset that stream with the
   REFUSED_STREAM error code (Section 8.7 of [HTTP2]).

   A WebTransport server that wishes to reduce the value of
   SETTINGS_WT_MAX_SESSIONS to a value that is below the current number
   of open sessions can either close sessions that exceed the new value
   or allow those sessions to complete.  Endpoints MUST NOT reduce the
   value of SETTINGS_WT_MAX_SESSIONS to "0" after previously advertising
   a non-zero value.

   Just like other HTTP requests, WebTransport sessions, and data sent
   on those sessions, are counted against flow control limits.  Servers
   that wish to limit the rate of incoming requests on any particular
   session have multiple mechanisms:

   *  The REFUSED_STREAM error code defined in Section 8.7 of [HTTP2]
      indicates to the receiving HTTP/2 stack that the request was not
      processed in any way.

   *  HTTP status code 429 indicates that the request was rejected due
      to rate limiting [RFC6585].  Unlike the previous method, this
      signal is directly propagated to the application.

4.2.  Limiting the Number of Streams Within a Session

   The WT_MAX_STREAMS capsule (Section 5.6.1 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H3])
   allows each endpoint to limit the number of streams its peer is
   permitted to open as part of a WebTransport session.  There is a
   separate limit for bidirectional streams and for unidirectional
   streams.  Note that, unlike WebTransport over HTTP/3
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H3], because the entire WebTransport session is
   contained within HTTP/2 DATA frames on a single HTTP/2 stream, this
   limit is the only mechanism for an endpoint to limit the number of
   WebTransport streams that its peer can open on a session.

4.3.  Initial Flow Control Limits

   To allow stream data to be exchanged in the same flight as the
   extended CONNECT request that establishes a WebTransport session,
   initial flow control limits can be exchanged via HTTP/2 SETTINGS
   (Section 4.3.1).  Initial values for the flow control limits can also
   be exchanged via the WebTransport-Init header field on the extended
   CONNECT request (Section 4.3.2).

   The limits communicated via HTTP/2 SETTINGS apply to all WebTransport
   sessions opened on that HTTP/2 connection.  Limits communicated via
   the WebTransport-Init header field apply only to the WebTransport
   session established by the extended CONNECT request carrying that
   field.

   If both the SETTINGS and the header field are present when a
   WebTransport session is established, the endpoint MUST use the
   greater of the two values for each corresponding initial flow control
   value.  Endpoints sending the SETTINGS and also including the header
   field SHOULD ensure that the header field values are greater than or
   equal to the values provided in the SETTINGS.

4.3.1.  Flow Control SETTINGS

   Initial flow control limits can be exchanged via HTTP/2 SETTINGS
   (Section 11.1) by providing non-zero values for

   *  WT_MAX_DATA via SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_DATA

   *  WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA via SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAM_DATA_UNI and
      SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAM_DATA_BIDI

   *  WT_MAX_STREAMS via SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAMS_UNI and
      SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAMS_BIDI

4.3.2.  Flow Control Header Field

   The WebTransport-Init HTTP header field can be used to communicate
   the initial values of the flow control windows, similar to how QUIC
   uses transport parameters.  The WebTransport-Init is a Dictionary
   Structured Field (Section 3.2 of [RFC8941]).  If the WebTransport-
   Init field cannot be parsed correctly or does not have the correct
   type, the endpoint MUST reject the CONNECT request with a 4xx status
   code.  The following keys are defined for the WebTransport-Init
   header field:

   u:  The initial flow control limit for unidirectional streams opened
      by the recipient of this header field.  MUST be an Integer.

   bl:  The initial flow control limit for the bidirectional streams
      opened by the sender of this header field.  MUST be an Integer.

   br:  The initial flow control limit for the bidirectional streams
      opened by the recipient of this header field.  MUST be an Integer.

   If any of these keys are present but contain invalid values, the
   endpoint MUST reject the CONNECT request with a 4xx status code.
   Unknown keys and parameters in the dictionary MUST be ignored.

4.4.  Flow Control and Intermediaries

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 uses several capsules for flow control, and
   all of these capsules define special intermediary handling as
   described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  These capsules,
   referred to as the "flow control capsules" are WT_MAX_DATA,
   WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA, WT_MAX_STREAMS, WT_DATA_BLOCKED,
   WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED, and WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED.

   Because flow control in WebTransport is hop-by-hop and does not
   provide an end-to-end signal, intermediaries MUST consume flow
   control signals and express their own flow control limits to the next
   hop.  The intermediary can send these signals via HTTP/3 flow control
   messages, HTTP/2 flow control messages, or as WebTransport flow
   control capsules, where appropriate.  Intermediaries are responsible
   for storing any data for which they advertise flow control credit if
   that data cannot be immediately forwarded to the next hop.

   In practice, an intermediary that translates flow control signals
   between similar WebTransport protocols, such as between two HTTP/2
   connections, can often simply reexpress the same limits received on
   one connection directly on the other connection.

   An intermediary that does not want to be responsible for storing data
   that cannot be immediately sent on its translated connection would
   ensure that it does not advertise a higher flow control limit on one
   connection than the corresponding limit on the translated connection.

5.  WebTransport Features

   WebTransport over TCP-based HTTP semantics provides the following
   features described in [OVERVIEW]: unidirectional streams,
   bidirectional streams, and datagrams, initiated by either endpoint.

   WebTransport streams and datagrams that belong to different
   WebTransport sessions are identified by the CONNECT stream on which
   they are transmitted, with one WebTransport session consuming one
   CONNECT stream.

5.1.  Transport Properties

   The WebTransport framework [OVERVIEW] defines a set of optional
   transport properties that clients can use to determine the presence
   of features which might allow additional optimizations beyond the
   common set of properties available via all WebTransport protocols.

   Because WebTransport over TCP-based HTTP semantics relies on the
   underlying protocols to provide in order and reliable delivery, there
   are some notable differences from the way in which QUIC handles
   application data.  For example, endpoints send stream data in order.
   As there is no ordering mechanism available for the receiver to
   reassemble incoming data, receivers assume that all data arriving in
   WT_STREAM capsules is contiguous and in order.

   Below are details about support in WebTransport over HTTP/2 for the
   properties defined by the WebTransport framework.

   Stream Independence:  WebTransport over HTTP/2 does not support
      stream independence, as HTTP/2 inherently has head-of-line
      blocking.

   Partial Reliability:  WebTransport over HTTP/2 does not support
      partial reliability, as HTTP/2 retransmits any lost data.  This
      means that any datagrams sent via WebTransport over HTTP/2 will be
      retransmitted regardless of the preference of the application.
      The receiver is permitted to drop them, however, if it is unable
      to buffer them.

   Pooling Support:  WebTransport over HTTP/2 supports pooling, as
      multiple transports using WebTransport over HTTP/2 may share the
      same underlying HTTP/2 connection and therefore share a congestion
      controller and other transport context.  Note that WebTransport
      streams over HTTP/2 are contained within a single HTTP/2 stream
      and do not compete with other pooled WebTransport sessions for
      per-stream resources.

   Connection Mobility:  WebTransport over HTTP/2 does not support
      connection mobility, unless an underlying transport protocol that
      supports multipath or migration, such as MPTCP [MPTCP], is used
      underneath HTTP/2 and TLS.  Without such support, WebTransport
      over HTTP/2 connections cannot survive network transitions.

5.2.  WebTransport Streams

   WebTransport streams have identifiers and states that mirror the
   identifiers ((Section 2.1 of [RFC9000])) and states (Section 3 of
   [RFC9000]) of QUIC streams as closely as possible to aid in ease of
   implementation.

   WebTransport streams are identified by a numeric value, or stream ID.
   Stream IDs are only meaningful within the WebTransport session in
   which they were created.  They share the same semantics as QUIC
   stream IDs, with client initiated streams having even-numbered stream
   IDs and server-initiated streams having odd-numbered stream IDs.
   Similarly, they can be bidirectional or unidirectional, indicated by
   the second least significant bit of the stream ID.

   Because WebTransport does not provide an acknowledgement mechanism
   for WebTransport capsules, it relies on the underlying transport's in
   order delivery to inform stream state transitions.  Wherever QUIC
   relies on receiving an ack for a packet to transition between stream
   states, WebTransport performs that transition immediately.

5.3.  Use of Keying Material Exporters

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 supports the use of TLS keying material
   exporters Section 7.5 of [TLS].  Since the underlying HTTP/2
   connection could be shared by multiple WebTransport sessions,
   WebTransport defines a mechanism for deriving a TLS exporter that
   separates keying material for different sessions.  If the application
   requests an exporter for a given WebTransport session with a
   specified label and context, the resulting exporter SHALL be a TLS
   exporter as defined in Section 7.5 of [TLS] with the label set to
   "EXPORTER-WebTransport" and the context set to the serialization of
   the "WebTransport Exporter Context" struct as defined below.

   WebTransport Exporter Context {
     WebTransport Session ID (64),
     WebTransport Application-Supplied Exporter Label Length (8),
     WebTransport Application-Supplied Exporter Label (8..),
     WebTransport Application-Supplied Exporter Context Length (8),
     WebTransport Application-Supplied Exporter Context (..)
   }

               Figure 1: WebTransport Exporter Context struct

   A TLS exporter API might permit the context field to be omitted.  In
   this case, as with TLS 1.3, the WebTransport Application-Supplied
   Exporter Context becomes zero-length if omitted.

6.  WebTransport Capsules

   WebTransport capsules mirror their QUIC frame counterparts as closely
   as possible to enable maximal reuse of any applicable QUIC
   infrastructure by implementors.

   WebTransport capsules use the Capsule Protocol defined in Section 3.2
   of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].

6.1.  PADDING Capsule

   A PADDING capsule is an HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] of
   type=0x190B4D38 and has no semantic value.  PADDING capsules can be
   used to introduce additional data between other HTTP datagrams and
   can also be used to provide protection against traffic analysis or
   for other reasons.

   Note that, when used with WebTransport over HTTP/2, the PADDING
   capsule exists alongside the ability to pad HTTP/2 frames
   (Section 10.7 of [RFC9113]).  HTTP/2 padding is hop-by-hop and can be
   modified by intermediaries, while the PADDING capsule traverses
   intermediaries.  The PADDING capsule cannot be smaller than its own
   header, which means that the minimum size of the capsule is two
   bytes: one byte for the Type and one byte to encode "0" for the
   Length.

   PADDING Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x190B4D38,
     Length (i),
     Padding (..),
   }

                      Figure 2: PADDING Capsule Format

   The Padding field MUST be set to an all-zero sequence of bytes of any
   length as specified by the Length field.  A receiver is not obligated
   to verify padding but MAY treat non-zero padding as a stream error
   (Section 3.5).

6.2.  WT_RESET_STREAM Capsule

   A WT_RESET_STREAM capsule is an HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] of
   type=0x190B4D39 and allows either endpoint to abruptly terminate the
   sending part of a WebTransport stream.

   After sending a WT_RESET_STREAM capsule, an endpoint ceases
   transmission of WT_STREAM capsules on the identified stream.  A
   receiver of a WT_RESET_STREAM capsule can discard any data in excess
   of the Reliable Size indicated, even if that data was already
   received.

   The WT_RESET_STREAM capsule follows the design of the QUIC
   RESET_STREAM_AT frame [PARTIAL-RESET].  Consequently, it includes a
   Reliable Size field.  A WT_RESET_STREAM capsule MUST be sent after
   WT_STREAM capsules that include an amount of data equal to or in
   excess of the value in the Reliable Size field.  A receiver MUST
   treat the receipt of a WT_RESET_STREAM with a Reliable Size smaller
   than the number of bytes it has received on the stream as a session
   error.

   WT_RESET_STREAM Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x190B4D39,
     Length (i),
     Stream ID (i),
     Application Protocol Error Code (i),
     Reliable Size (i),
   }

                  Figure 3: WT_RESET_STREAM Capsule Format

   The WT_RESET_STREAM capsule defines the following fields:

   Stream ID:  A variable-length integer encoding of the WebTransport
      stream ID of the stream being terminated.

   Application Protocol Error Code:  A variable-length integer
      containing the application protocol error code that indicates why
      the stream is being closed.

   Reliable Size:  A variable-length integer indicating the amount of
      data that needs to be delivered to the application even though the
      stream is reset.

   Unlike the equivalent QUIC frame, this capsule does not include a
   Final Size field.  In-order delivery of WT_STREAM capsules ensures
   that the amount of session-level flow control consumed by a stream is
   always known by both endpoints.

   A WT_RESET_STREAM capsule MUST NOT be sent after a stream is closed
   or reset.  While QUIC permits redundant RESET_STREAM frames, the
   ordering guarantee in HTTP/2 makes this unnecessary.  A stream error
   (Section 3.5) of type WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM_STATE_ERROR MUST be sent if
   a WT_RESET_STREAM capsule is received for a stream that is not in a
   valid state.

6.3.  WT_STOP_SENDING Capsule

   An HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] called WT_STOP_SENDING
   (type=0x190B4D3A) is introduced to communicate that incoming data is
   being discarded on receipt per application request.  WT_STOP_SENDING
   requests that a peer cease transmission on a WebTransport stream.

   WT_STOP_SENDING Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x190B4D3A,
     Length (i),
     Stream ID (i),
     Application Protocol Error Code (i),
   }

                  Figure 4: WT_STOP_SENDING Capsule Format

   The WT_STOP_SENDING capsule defines the following fields:

   Stream ID:  A variable-length integer carrying the WebTransport
      stream ID of the stream being ignored.

   Application Protocol Error Code:  A variable-length integer
      containing the application-specified reason the sender is ignoring
      the stream.

   As defined in Section 3.5 of [RFC9000], the recipient of a
   WT_STOP_SENDING capsule sends a WT_RESET_STREAM capsule in response,
   including the same error code, if the stream is the "Ready" or "Send"
   state.

   A WT_STOP_SENDING capsule MUST NOT be sent multiple times for the
   same stream.  While QUIC permits redundant STOP_SENDING frames, the
   ordering guarantee in HTTP/2 makes this unnecessary.  A stream error
   (Section 3.5) of type WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM_STATE_ERROR MUST be sent if
   a second WT_STOP_SENDING capsule is received.

6.4.  WT_STREAM Capsule

   WT_STREAM capsules implicitly create a WebTransport stream and carry
   stream data.

   The Type field in the WT_STREAM capsule is either 0x190B4D3B or
   0x190B4D3C.  The least significant bit in the capsule type is the FIN
   bit (0x01), indicating when set that the capsule marks the end of the
   stream in one direction.  Stream data consists of any number of
   0x190B4D3B capsules followed by a terminal 0x190B4D3C capsule.

   WT_STREAM Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x190B4D3B..0x190B4D3C,
     Length (i),
     Stream ID (i),
     Stream Data (..),
   }

                     Figure 5: WT_STREAM Capsule Format

   WT_STREAM capsules contain the following fields:

   Stream ID:  The stream ID for the stream.  The second least
      significant bit of the Stream ID indicates whether the stream is
      bidirectional or unidirectional, as described in Section 5.2.

   Stream Data:  Zero or more bytes of data for the stream.  Empty
      WT_STREAM capsules MUST NOT be used unless they open or close a
      stream; an endpoint MAY treat an empty WT_STREAM capsule that
      neither starts nor ends a stream as a session error.

   A WT_STREAM capsule MUST NOT be sent after a stream is closed or
   reset.  While QUIC permits redundant STREAM frames, the ordering
   guarantee in HTTP/2 makes this unnecessary.  A stream error
   (Section 3.5) of type WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM_STATE_ERROR MUST be sent if
   a WT_STREAM capsule is received for a stream that is not in a valid
   state.

6.5.  WT_MAX_DATA Capsule

   An HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] called WT_MAX_DATA (type=0x190B4D3D)
   (Section 5.4.3 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H3]) is used to inform the peer of
   the maximum amount of data that can be sent on the WebTransport
   session as a whole.

   WT_MAX_DATA Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x190B4D3D,
     Length (i),
     Maximum Data (i),
   }

                    Figure 6: WT_MAX_DATA Capsule Format

   WT_MAX_DATA capsules contain the following field:

   Maximum Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the maximum
      amount of data that can be sent on the entire connection, in units
      of bytes.

   All data sent in WT_STREAM capsules counts toward this limit.  The
   sum of the lengths of Stream Data fields in WT_STREAM capsules MUST
   NOT exceed the value advertised by a receiver.

   The WT_MAX_DATA capsule defines special intermediary handling, as
   described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  Intermediaries MUST
   consume WT_MAX_DATA capsules for flow control purposes and MUST
   generate and send appropriate flow control signals for their limits;
   see Section 4.4.

   The initial value for this limit MAY be communicated by sending a
   non-zero value for SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_DATA.

6.6.  WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA Capsule

   An HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] called WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA
   (type=0x190B4D3E) is introduced to inform a peer of the maximum
   amount of data that can be sent on a WebTransport stream.

   WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x190B4D3E,
     Length (i),
     Stream ID (i),
     Maximum Stream Data (i),
   }

                Figure 7: WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA Capsule Format

   WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA capsules contain the following fields:

   Stream ID:  The stream ID of the affected WebTransport stream,
      encoded as a variable-length integer.

   Maximum Stream Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the
      maximum amount of data that can be sent on the identified stream,
      in units of bytes.

   All data sent in WT_STREAM capsules for the identified stream counts
   toward this limit.  The sum of the lengths of Stream Data fields in
   WT_STREAM capsules on the identified stream MUST NOT exceed the value
   advertised by a receiver.

   The WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA capsule defines special intermediary handling,
   as described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  Intermediaries MUST
   consume WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA capsules for flow control purposes and
   MUST generate and send appropriate flow control signals for their
   limits; see Section 4.4.

   Initial values for this limit for unidirectional and bidirectional
   streams MAY be communicated by sending non-zero values for
   SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAM_DATA_UNI and
   SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAM_DATA_BIDI respectively.

   A WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA capsule MUST NOT be sent after a sender requests
   that a stream be closed with WT_STOP_SENDING.  While QUIC permits
   redundant MAX_STREAM_DATA frames, the ordering guarantee in HTTP/2
   makes this unnecessary.  A stream error (Section 3.5) of type
   WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM_STATE_ERROR MUST be sent if a WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA
   capsule is received after a WT_STOP_SENDING capsule for the same
   stream.

6.7.  WT_MAX_STREAMS Capsule

   An HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] called WT_MAX_STREAMS is defined by
   Section 5.6.1 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H3] to inform the peer of the
   cumulative number of streams of a given type it is permitted to open.
   A WT_MAX_STREAMS capsule with a type of 0x190B4D3F applies to
   bidirectional streams, and a WT_MAX_STREAMS capsule with a type of
   0x190B4D40 applies to unidirectional streams.

   Note that, because Maximum Streams is a cumulative value representing
   the total allowed number of streams, including previously closed
   streams, endpoints repeatedly send new WT_MAX_STREAMS capsules with
   increasing Maximum Streams values as streams are opened.

   WT_MAX_STREAMS Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x190B4D3F..0x190B4D40,
     Length (i),
     Maximum Streams (i),
   }

                  Figure 8: WT_MAX_STREAMS Capsule Format

   WT_MAX_STREAMS capsules contain the following field:

   Maximum Streams:  A count of the cumulative number of streams of the
      corresponding type that can be opened over the lifetime of the
      connection.  This value cannot exceed 2^60, as it is not possible
      to encode stream IDs larger than 2^62-1.

   An endpoint MUST NOT open more streams than permitted by the current
   stream limit set by its peer.  For instance, a server that receives a
   unidirectional stream limit of 3 is permitted to open streams 3, 7,
   and 11, but not stream 15.

   Note that this limit includes streams that have been closed as well
   as those that are open.

   The WT_MAX_STREAMS capsule defines special intermediary handling, as
   described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  Intermediaries MUST
   consume WT_MAX_STREAMS capsules for flow control purposes and MUST
   generate and send appropriate flow control signals for their limits.

   Initial values for these limits MAY be communicated by sending non-
   zero values for SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAMS_UNI and
   SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAMS_BIDI.

6.8.  WT_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule

   A sender SHOULD send a WT_DATA_BLOCKED capsule (type=0x190B4D41)
   (Section 5.6.4 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H3]) when it wishes to send data but
   is unable to do so due to WebTransport session-level flow control.
   WT_DATA_BLOCKED capsules can be used as input to tuning of flow
   control algorithms.

   WT_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x190B4D41,
     Length (i),
     Maximum Data (i),
   }

                  Figure 9: WT_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule Format

   WT_DATA_BLOCKED capsules contain the following field:

   Maximum Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the session-level
      limit at which blocking occurred.

   The WT_DATA_BLOCKED capsule defines special intermediary handling, as
   described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  Intermediaries MUST
   consume WT_DATA_BLOCKED capsules for flow control purposes and MUST
   generate and send appropriate flow control signals for their limits;
   see Section 4.4.

6.9.  WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule

   A sender SHOULD send a WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsule
   (type=0x190B4D42) when it wishes to send data but is unable to do so
   due to stream-level flow control.  This capsule is analogous to
   WT_DATA_BLOCKED.

   WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x190B4D42,
     Length (i),
     Stream ID (i),
     Maximum Stream Data (i),
   }

              Figure 10: WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule Format

   WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsules contain the following fields:

   Stream ID:  A variable-length integer indicating the WebTransport
      stream that is blocked due to flow control.

   Maximum Stream Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the offset
      of the stream at which the blocking occurred.

   The WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsule defines special intermediary
   handling, as described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].
   Intermediaries MUST consume WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsules for flow
   control purposes and MUST generate and send appropriate flow control
   signals for their limits; see Section 4.4.

   A WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsule MUST NOT be sent after a stream is
   closed or reset.  While QUIC permits redundant STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED
   frames, the ordering guarantee in HTTP/2 makes this unnecessary.  A
   stream error (Section 3.5) of type WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM_STATE_ERROR
   MUST be sent if a WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsule is received for a
   stream that is not in a valid state.

6.10.  WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED Capsule

   A sender SHOULD send a WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsule (type=0x190B4D43 or
   0x190B4D44) (Section 5.4.2 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H3]) when it wishes to
   open a stream but is unable to do so due to the maximum stream limit
   set by its peer.  A WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsule of type 0x190B4D43 is
   used to indicate reaching the bidirectional stream limit, and a
   STREAMS_BLOCKED capsule of type 0x190B4D44 is used to indicate
   reaching the unidirectional stream limit.

   A WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsule does not open the stream, but informs
   the peer that a new stream was needed and the stream limit prevented
   the creation of the stream.

   WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x190B4D43..0x190B4D44,
     Length (i),
     Maximum Streams (i),
   }

                Figure 11: WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED Capsule Format

   WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsules contain the following field:

   Maximum Streams:  A variable-length integer indicating the maximum
      number of streams allowed at the time the capsule was sent.  This
      value cannot exceed 2^60, as it is not possible to encode stream
      IDs larger than 2^62-1.

   The WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsule defines special intermediary handling,
   as described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  Intermediaries MUST
   consume WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsules for flow control purposes and
   MUST generate and send appropriate flow control signals for their
   limits.

6.11.  DATAGRAM Capsule

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 uses the DATAGRAM capsule defined in
   Section 3.5 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM] to carry datagram traffic.

   DATAGRAM Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x00,
     Length (i),
     HTTP Datagram Payload (..),
   }

                     Figure 12: DATAGRAM Capsule Format

   When used in WebTransport over HTTP/2, DATAGRAM capsules contain the
   following fields:

   HTTP Datagram Payload:  The content of the datagram to be delivered.

   The data in DATAGRAM capsules is not subject to flow control.  The
   receiver MAY discard this data if it does not have sufficient space
   to buffer it.

   An intermediary could forward the data in a DATAGRAM capsule over
   another protocol, such as WebTransport over HTTP/3.  In QUIC, a
   datagram frame can span at most one packet.  Because of that, the
   applications have to know the maximum size of the datagram they can
   send.  However, when proxying the datagrams, the hop-by-hop MTUs can
   vary.

   Section 3.5 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM] indicates that intermediaries that
   forward DATAGRAM capsules where QUIC datagrams [DATAGRAM] are
   available forward the contents of the capsule as native QUIC
   datagrams, rather than as HTTP datagrams in a DATAGRAM capsule.
   Similarly, when forwarding DATAGRAM capsules used as part of a
   WebTransport over HTTP/2 session on a WebTransport session that
   natively supports QUIC datagrams, such as WebTransport over HTTP/3
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H3], intermediaries follow the requirements in
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H3] to use native QUIC datagrams.

6.12.  WT_CLOSE_SESSION Capsule

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 uses the WT_CLOSE_SESSION capsule defined in
   Section 5 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H3] to terminate a WebTransport session
   with an application error code and message.

   WebTransport sessions can be terminated by optionally sending a
   WT_CLOSE_SESSION capsule and then by closing the HTTP/2 stream
   associated with the session (see Section 3.5).

   WT_CLOSE_SESSION Capsule {
     Type (i) = WT_CLOSE_SESSION,
     Length (i),
     Application Error Code (32),
     Application Error Message (..8192),
   }

                 Figure 13: WT_CLOSE_SESSION Capsule Format

   When used in WebTransport over HTTP/2, WT_CLOSE_SESSION capsules
   contain the following fields:

   Application Error Code:  A 32-bit error code provided by the
      application closing the connection.

   Application Error Message:  A UTF-8 encoded error message string
      provided by the application closing the connection.  The message
      takes up the remainder of the capsule, and its length MUST NOT
      exceed 1024 bytes.

   An endpoint that sends a WT_CLOSE_SESSION capsule MUST then close the
   stream.  The recipient MUST close the stream upon receipt of the
   capsule.

   Cleanly terminating a WebTransport session without a WT_CLOSE_SESSION
   capsule is semantically equivalent to terminating it with a
   WT_CLOSE_SESSION capsule that has an error code of 0 and an empty
   error string.

6.13.  WT_DRAIN_SESSION Capsule

   HTTP/2 uses GOAWAY frames (Section 6.8 of [HTTP2]) to allow an
   endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new streams while still
   finishing processing of previously established streams.

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 uses the WT_DRAIN_SESSION capsule defined in
   Section 4.6 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H3] to gracefully shut down a
   WebTransport session.

   WT_DRAIN_SESSION Capsule {
     Type (i) = WT_DRAIN_SESSION,
     Length (i) = 0
   }

                 Figure 14: WT_DRAIN_SESSION Capsule Format

   After sending or receiving either a WT_DRAIN_SESSION capsule or
   HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame, an endpoint MAY continue using the session and
   MAY open new WebTransport streams.  The signal is intended for the
   application using WebTransport, which is expected to attempt to
   gracefully terminate the session as soon as possible.

6.14.  Capsule Ordering and Reliability

   The use of an ordered and reliable transport means that a receiver
   does not need to tolerate capsules that arrive out of order.  This
   differs from QUIC in that a receiver is required to treat the arrival
   of out of order frames rather than being tolerant.

   For an intermediary that forwards from an strongly-ordered transport
   (like [WEBTRANSPORT-H3]) to a reliable transport (like this
   protocol), it is necessary to maintain state for streams.  A simple
   forwarding intermediary that directly translates one type of protocol
   unit into another without understanding the underlying state might
   cause a receiver to abort the session.

   For instance, after a RESET_STREAM frame is forwarded, an
   intermediary cannot forward a RESET_STREAM frame as a WT_RESET_STREAM
   capsule or a STREAM frame as a WT_STREAM capsule without error.

7.  Requirements on TLS Usage

   Because TLS keying material exporters are only secure for
   authentication when they are uniquely bound to the TLS session
   [RFC7627], WebTransport requires either one of the following
   conditions:

   *  The TLS version in use is greater than or equal to 1.3 [TLS].

   *  The TLS version in use is 1.2, and the extended master secret
      extension [RFC7627] has been negotiated.

   Clients MUST NOT send WebTransport over HTTP/2 requests on
   connections that do not meet one of the two conditions above.  If a
   server receives a WebTransport over HTTP/2 request on a connection
   that meets neither, the server MUST treat the request as malformed,
   as specified in Section 8.1.1 of [HTTP2].

8.  Examples

   An example of negotiating a WebTransport Stream on an HTTP/2
   connection follows.  This example is intended to closely follow the
   example in Section 5.1 of [RFC8441] to help illustrate the
   differences defined in this document.

[[ From Client ]]                   [[ From Server ]]

                                    HEADERS + END_HEADERS
                                    Stream ID = 3
                                    :status = 200

                                    WT_STREAM + FIN

                                    WebTransport Data

WT_STREAM + FIN
Stream ID = 0
WebTransport Data

   An example of the server initiating a WebTransport Stream follows.
   The only difference here is the endpoint that sends the first
   WT_STREAM capsule.

[[ From Client ]]                   [[ From Server ]]

                                    SETTINGS

                                    SETTINGS_WT_MAX_SESSIONS = 100

9.  Considerations for Future Versions

   Future versions of WebTransport that change the syntax of the CONNECT
   requests used to establish WebTransport sessions will need to modify
   the upgrade token used to identify WebTransport, allowing servers to
   offer multiple versions simultaneously (Section 9.1 of
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H3]).

   Servers that support future incompatible versions of WebTransport
   signal that support by changing the codepoint used for the
   SETTINGS_WT_MAX_SESSIONS parameter (see Section 11.1).  Clients can
   select the associated upgrade token, if applicable, to use when
   establishing a new session, ensuring that servers will always know
   the syntax in use for every incoming request.

10.  Security Considerations

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 satisfies all of the security requirements
   imposed by [OVERVIEW] on WebTransport protocols, thus providing a
   secure framework for client-server communication in cases when the
   client is potentially untrusted.

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 requires explicit opt-in through the use of
   HTTP SETTINGS; this avoids potential protocol confusion attacks by
   ensuring the HTTP/2 server explicitly supports it.  It also requires
   the use of the Origin header, providing the server with the ability
   to deny access to Web-based clients that do not originate from a
   trusted origin.

   Just like HTTP traffic going over HTTP/2, WebTransport pools traffic
   to different origins within a single connection.  Different origins
   imply different trust domains, meaning that the implementations have
   to treat each transport as potentially hostile towards others on the
   same connection.  One potential attack is a resource exhaustion
   attack: since all of the transports share both congestion control and
   flow control context, a single client aggressively using up those
   resources can cause other transports to stall.  The user agent thus
   SHOULD implement a fairness scheme that ensures that each transport
   within connection gets a reasonable share of controlled resources;
   this applies both to sending data and to opening new streams.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers new HTTP/2 settings (Section 11.1), HTTP/2
   error codes (Section 11.2), new capsules (Section 11.3), and the
   WebTransport-Init header field (Section 11.4).

11.1.  HTTP/2 SETTINGS Parameter Registration

   The following entries are added to the "HTTP/2 Settings" registry
   established by [HTTP2]:

   The SETTINGS_WT_MAX_SESSIONS parameter indicates that the specified
   HTTP/2 connection is WebTransport-capable and the number of
   concurrent sessions an endpoint is willing to receive.  The default
   value for the SETTINGS_WT_MAX_SESSIONS parameter is "0", meaning that
   the endpoint is not willing to receive any WebTransport sessions.

   Setting Name:  WEBTRANSPORT_MAX_SESSIONS

   Value:  0x2b60

   Default:  0

   Specification:  This document

   The SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_DATA parameter indicates the initial
   value for the session data limit, otherwise communicated by the
   WT_MAX_DATA capsule (Section 6.5).  The default value for the
   SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_DATA parameter is "0", indicating that the
   endpoint needs to send a WT_MAX_DATA capsule within each session
   before its peer is allowed to send any stream data within that
   session.

   Note that this limit applies to all WebTransport sessions that use
   the HTTP/2 connection on which this SETTING is sent.

   Setting Name:  SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_DATA

   Value:  0x2b61

   Default:  0

   Specification:  This document

   The SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAM_DATA_UNI parameter indicates the
   initial value for the stream data limit for incoming unidirectional
   streams, otherwise communicated by the WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA
   capsule(Section 6.6).  The default value for the
   SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAM_DATA_UNI parameter is "0", indicating
   that the endpoint needs to send WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA capsules for each
   stream within each individual WebTransport session before its peer is
   allowed to send any stream data on those streams.

   Note that this limit applies to all WebTransport streams on all
   sessions that use the HTTP/2 connection on which this SETTING is
   sent.

   Setting Name:  SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAM_DATA_UNI

   Value:  0x2b62

   Default:  0

   Specification:  This document

   The SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAM_DATA_BIDI parameter indicates the
   initial value for the stream data limit for incoming data on
   bidirectional streams, otherwise communicated by the
   WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA capsule (Section 6.6).  The default value for the
   SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAM_DATA_BIDI parameter is "0", indicating
   that the endpoint needs to send WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA capsules for each
   stream within each individual WebTransport session before its peer is
   allowed to send any stream data on those streams.

   Note that this limit applies to all WebTransport streams on all
   sessions that use the HTTP/2 connection on which this SETTING is
   sent.

   Setting Name:  SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAM_DATA_BIDI

   Value:  0x2b63

   Default:  0

   Specification:  This document

   The SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAMS_UNI parameter indicates the
   initial value for the unidirectional max stream limit, otherwise
   communicated by the WT_MAX_STREAMS capsule (Section 6.7).  The
   default value for the SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAMS_UNI parameter
   is "0", indicating that the endpoint needs to send WT_MAX_STREAMS
   capsules on each individual WebTransport session before its peer is
   allowed to create any unidirectional streams within that session.

   Note that this limit applies to all WebTransport sessions that use
   the HTTP/2 connection on which this SETTING is sent.

   Setting Name:  SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAMS_UNI

   Value:  0x2b64

   Default:  0

   Specification:  This document

   The SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAMS_BIDI parameter indicates the
   initial value for the bidirectional max stream limit, otherwise
   communicated by the WT_MAX_STREAMS capsule (Section 6.7).  The
   default value for the SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAMS_BIDI parameter
   is "0", indicating that the endpoint needs to send WT_MAX_STREAMS
   capsules on each individual WebTransport session before its peer is
   allowed to create any bidirectional streams within that session.

   Note that this limit applies to all WebTransport sessions that use
   the HTTP/2 connection on which this SETTING is sent.

   Setting Name:  SETTINGS_WT_INITIAL_MAX_STREAMS_BIDI

   Value:  0x2b65

   Default:  0

   Specification:  This document

11.2.  HTTP/2 Error Code Registration

   The following entries are added to the "HTTP/2 Error Code" registry
   established by [HTTP2]:

   For WEBTRANSPORT_ERROR:

   Code:  0xTBD

   Name:  WEBTRANSPORT_ERROR

   Description:  General WebTransport error detected

   Reference:  Section 3.5

   For WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM_STATE_ERROR:

   Code:  0xTBD

   Name:  WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM_STATE_ERROR

   Description:  Unexpected WebTransport stream-related capsule received

   Reference:  Section 3.5

11.3.  Capsule Types
